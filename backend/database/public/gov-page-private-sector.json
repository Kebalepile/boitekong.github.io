To mitigate this, The Service Lab put in place a change management function that was flagged as the hub where the gold standard of change management was maintained. With E-Volve now starting to expand to the rest of the group, there is a demand for this critical service to be established on a permanent basis with The Service Lab to continue delivering projects with world class change management standards, not just in Health, but as a service to all companies across the group given that E-Volve and AWS are already group-wide projects. \n \nJob Purpose:\nTo own E- Volve, a Service Lab product which is one of the largest technical implementations in the company.
